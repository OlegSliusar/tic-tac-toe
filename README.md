# Tic-tac-toe
Tic-tac-toe (also known as noughts and crosses or Xs and Os) is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

**This** is a command line implementation of the game, assigned from [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/oop).

The point of the project is to practice **OOP** in Ruby.
